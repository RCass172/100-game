### Project Goals

The primary goal of this project was to complete a challenge from [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. The following flowchart was given which I used to complete the game, with starter HTML and CSS files given ![flowchart](imgs/pig-game-flowchart.png)

### Extra

As an extra I created a modal which displays when page is loaded. This shows the rules of the game, along with allowing players to enter a name. If no name is entered a default "Player 1" or "Player 2" will be displayed. ![modal](imgs/game02.png)
